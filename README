Before starting the app, you will need to execute the build_resources.sh script once
and every time any file in the ui/ dir gets updated by you or by a git pull.

Cheers.

Extract from a chat with eviy:

191906     +eviy  the dispersy directory is from the mainbranch
191912     +eviy  the rest is new code

191953     +eviy  it could ve usefull to understand how dispersy works, or at least how it can be used (that was the intended purpose)

192026     +eviy  two small notes:
192114     +eviy  1. i disabled the crypto (dispersy/crypto.py) at the start of the file there is an 'if True/False' statement to do that
192149     +eviy  2. it uses a special tracker (sinse the normal trackers expect that crypro is working)
192234     +eviy  2. you can find the alternate tracker in the dispersy/bootstrap.py file in the chat-demo.tar

192245    +whirm  why is crypto disabled? to make debugging easy or it requires some extra setup?
192336     +eviy  cryto requires a python package called 'M2Crypto'

192356     +eviy  and i didn't have time to find that package (if it even exists) on android
192437    +whirm  eviy: ok, ah, ok, I think it's not ported (for what I remember reading at the python 4 android site)
192444     +eviy  so disabling crypto replaces all crypto calles with dummy functions that give back a similar response
192504     +eviy  donno :(
192520     +eviy  M2Crypto is not even part of python, its a 3rd party package

192707     +eviy  the community/community.py file (in the chat-demo) is kinda the main code for handling the messages that dispersy disseminates
192811     +eviy  this file has a method called _initialize_meta_messages where all supported messages are defined
192825     +eviy  in the demo only one message exists 'text'
192911     +eviy  there are appropriate 'create' 'chec' and 'on_incoming' methods to handle the 'text' message, each is given as a parameter in _initialize_meta_messages
192934     +eviy  if you want to play around, you can add some messages that may or may not be usefull
193028     +eviy  there are several message policies that describe how dispersy should disseminate the message and to who'm.  also if someone needs permission to create it, etc
193126     +eviy  http://www.scribd.com/doc/81170037/Boudewijn-Dispersy-Documentation-DRAFT-2010
193158     +eviy  this is a a year old document that gives the basics of these policies
193204     +eviy  but it is outdated :(
193222     +eviy  but it may give an idea of what is and what isn't possible

193516     +eviy  dispersy is from the QLectives project.  soon there will be a new deliverable document that is much more up to date
193531     +eviy  but it hasn't been released yet :(


#About crypto keys:
175753  +eviy  whirm: you can run 'python dispersy/crypto.py' to create fresh public/private pairs
175851  +eviy  whirm: you copy the public key (they are HEX encoded) and put it in ChatCore.dispersy
175904  +eviy  whirm: replace 'public_key = "3081a7301006072a8648ce3d020...' with the new key
